Python script => HM-10 UART Notes (C0 to B9) => Tang Nano 20K Wave generation (SAW or SQU) => MCP4921 DAC (0-5V)

### Notes
I tried briefly outputting with a DAC0808 in a hacky 0-5V configuration and some conditioning,
 it kind of has character but is too fiddly to work with so i abandoned the idea.
